### React In Person Question 1


Assignment: For this particular app, make the app execute in such a way that all the

tests provided should be passed successfully.

NOTE:

1. One should follow ES6 standards while updating the app.

2. Default props provided, should not be changed.

3. At the moment tests are passed, open a PR in GIT with a screenshot of terminal in which 

   tests are passed.

4. Avoid changing the properties of App.

5. In PR, avoid alerts/consoles. 


## Running tests

Run these commands. You can use either `npm` or `yarn`.

```
npm install
npm test
```

## To see your output(although this is not really that necessary)

```
npm start
```
